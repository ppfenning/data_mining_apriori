# Instructions:

This midterm exam aims to test your understanding and application of the Apriori Algorithm. 
You are expected to write a Python program to implement this algorithm. 
In addition, you will compare your implementation with an existing Python library that performs the same task.

## Question 1: [70 Points]
Write a Python program that implements the Apriori algorithm. 
The program should take as input a list of transactions and a minimum support threshold. 
It should return all the frequent item sets that have a support greater than the threshold.
For example, if the list of transactions is [['bread', 'butter'], ['butter', 'milk'], ['bread'], ['bread', 'butter', 'milk'], ['butter', 'milk']] and the threshold is 0.6, your program should return [['butter'], ['bread', 'butter'], ['butter', 'milk']].

Write a function to test your program. 
The function should take as input a list of transactions and a threshold and print all the frequent item sets that your program finds. 
Use different lists of transactions and different thresholds for testing.


## Question 2: [30 Points]
Now use an existing Python library (like `MLxtend`) that implements the Apriori algorithm. 
Use the same data you used to test your program and compare the output of your program with the output of the library.
Discuss the similarities and differences between the output of your program and the library's output. 
What could explain any differences that you find?

### Submission:

Please submit your Python code as a `.py` file. 
Make sure your file includes comments explaining what each part of the code does. 
Also, include the data files you used for testing.

### Important Notes:

- Be sure to test your code with different inputs to ensure it works under different scenarios.

- Make sure your code is original. Plagiarized work will result in a score of zero for this exam.

- For question 2, remember to install the required library. If you're not sure how to do this, refer to the library's documentation.

- You will be graded not only on the correctness of your program but also on your coding style, including the use of meaningful variable names and comments.

 

Good luck!
